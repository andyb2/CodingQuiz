# Coding Quiz

## ```Goals for this project:```

This project was about creating a dynamic quiz that includes:

1. Quiz questions appearing without switching pages
2. Have a score tracker that uses local storage 
3. Have a timer that is reduced with every wrong question
4. After the quiz is done show what the user score is

## Challenges
I chose to have the quiz randomized. Each question that appears is pulled from a pool of questions and displayed
in a random order. There was a lot more time involved implementing this code because of trial and error.

## Screenshots
When the website is loaded a start button will appear asking the user to Start Quiz!

```Once the user has started the quiz a question will appear with a timer of 60 seconds.```

```When the user has finished the quiz a form will appear asking the user to input their name to save their score.```

```After the name is submitted the scores will appear.```

```The user is able to refresh the page and keep their scores```
